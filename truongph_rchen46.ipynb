        "Our goal is to research and find correlations between modern day technology users and their demographics. Our project focuses on understanding the current patterns that different groups tend to follow. This is an important issue because it shows what interests the younger and older generations are looking towards. This will help companies decide what they should focus on building towards because groups tend to follow trends. If people follow trends and companies develop products and ideas of those trends they will be able to exponentially grow their companie with their product and ideas."
